## Getting started

* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): `brew install node` on OS X
    * Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `npm install`

* Run:
    * `npm run start` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with
    * `npm run prod` — builds minified project for production

* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.
